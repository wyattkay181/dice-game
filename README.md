# Dice Game

A simple, modern dice-rolling game where you compete against the computer. Inspired by the style of [hands-game.netlify.app](https://hands-game.netlify.app/), but with dice instead of rock, paper, scissors.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Game Setup
- Create a minimal project structure (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
- Set up a simple UI: Roll Dice button, dice display for player and computer, message area, win/loss/tie counters, and reset button.
- Implement basic game logic: random dice rolls, outcome display, and counter updates.

### Phase 2: Visual Polish
- Apply a modern, dark UI theme inspired by the reference game.
- Add smooth CSS dice animations (e.g., shake or bounce on roll).

### Phase 3: Sound Effects
- Add sound effects for rolling, winning, and losing using JavaScript and standard audio playback.

### Phase 4: Enhancements & Refactoring
- Refactor code for modularity and maintainability.
- Add accessibility improvements and mobile responsiveness.
- Polish UI/UX details.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Optional/Future)
- Add game history, stats, or leaderboards.
- Support for multiple rounds or best-of series.
- Customization options (dice styles, themes, etc.).

## Game Rules
- Click the **Roll Dice** button to roll a die (1â€“6) for both you and the computer.
- Whoever rolls the higher number wins the round.
- Ties are possible if both roll the same number.
- Win, loss, and tie counters track your progress.
- Use the **Reset** button to clear the counters and start fresh.

## Features
- Modern, dark UI with smooth CSS dice animations.
- Sound effects for rolling, winning, and losing.
- No external frameworks or libraries used.

## How to Run Locally

2. Place sound files (`roll.mp3`, `win.mp3`, `lose.mp3`) in the project root (or use your own short sound effects).
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
