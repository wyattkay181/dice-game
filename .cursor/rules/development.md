# Development Guidelines

## Principles
- **Write clear and simple code**
- Prioritize **readability**
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Use **plain, maintainable vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML**
- Write code you can easily build in phases
- Avoid fancy abstractions, frameworks, or overly clever solutions
- Keep everything perfect for a small, CSS-only browser game

## Phase Checklist

### Phase 1: Basic Game Setup
- [ ] Minimal project structure (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)

- [ ] Accessibility improvements and mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Polish UI/UX details

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Optional/Future)
- [ ] Game history, stats, or leaderboards
- [ ] Support for multiple rounds or best-of series
- [ ] Customization options (dice styles, themes, etc.)
